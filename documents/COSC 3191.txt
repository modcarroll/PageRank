appropriate co-op course (3191 for the first semester, 3192 for the second semester, 3193 for the third semester) with the approval of the chair of computer science. A student will hold a full-time computer or information technology position for the entire semester of the co-op. During the semester of a co-op course a student will submit biweekly status reports and, in collaboration with the employer, submit at the end of the semester a performance appraisal/ evaluation by the employer.
